Welcome! My name is Madison Yonash and I am a student at Florida Polytechnic University, where I study business analytics with a concentration in Advanced Topics. My areas of interest include data storytelling, feature engineering, and model exploration.

At Florida Poly, I have served in a number of interesting roles that have helped me progress professionally and personally. Most notably, I founded and run the Women's Club Soccer Team and Women's Powerlifting Team. I also have served as a Foundation Board Director, Presidential Ambassador (as recruitment coordinator and secretary), Orientation Leader, and Admissions Ambassador. 

In the professional space, I have worked as a research assistant for two different projects at Florida Poly and have completed an internship with Gartner. 

I hope you enjoy my nerding out!
